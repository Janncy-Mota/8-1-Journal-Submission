The problem that I was having when it came to solving the projects for this course was mostly just figuring out how to structure my code. I ended up solving these issues though and had taken my time as well doing it, considering that it was a process. I approached the problem by looking up videos that I could follow along with and give me ideas of how to set up the structure of my program, along with guides that offer definitions for specific functions. Data structures are super important to understand over all because you donâ€™t want to be making errors or linking your program incorrectly, it could cause errors for the rest of the team and make it difficult for them to pick up from where you left off on. I made sure to add comments as well so that anyone who would look at the code itself was able to follow along with what it was that had been happening.
The roadblocks that I encountered were overcome by just telling myself what it was that I was going to do next, along with planning the projects in steps. This course as a whole has me thinking differently on arranging my programming assignments and making sure that they are functioning well. It also helped me out not with just creating the project itself but pseudocode as well which is key and just as important. This will help me not only now, but in the future as well considering that pseudocode is instrument to setting up the code as a whole.
